### Functionality
* Show your class, level and current area in your Discord Activity

### To-Be-Done
Implement the PoE API to require the user only to enter the characters name to pull class and current level.
The endpoints for that aren't public though and I need to contact PoE devs to register this application for it to work.

### How to use
1. Download the pre-built binary or build from source yourself
2. Open
3. Enter your Character's name
4. Hit 'Apply'

### Used libraries
* [discord-rpc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/discord-rpc)
* [poe-log-monitor](https://www.npmjs.com/package/poe-log-monitor)
